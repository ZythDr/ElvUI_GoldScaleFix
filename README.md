# ElvUI_GoldScaleFix
### Minimal plugin for [ElvUI-WotLK](https://github.com/ElvUI-WotLK/ElvUI) (3.3.5) plugin that aims to fix the scuffed gold DataText on low UI-scale setups.  

ElvUI_GoldScaleFix is a simple addon for ElvUI that lets you adjust the size and position of the Gold DataText icons.  

It may alter the scale and position of the coin icons with the default settings, but it's meant for the user to enter `/ec > GoldScaleFix` and change the scale and X-offset to best fit their resolution/UI scale.

Here's a before and after for my own setup (1440p with 0.65 UIScale), the GoldScaleFix settings are Scale: 1.1 and X-Offset: 3
